## Introduction
In this project, we have created an interactive number guessing game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game requires users to guess a secret "Magic Number." The user is prompted to enter their guess through a JavaScript prompt window. The script then checks if the guess matches the predefined "Magic Number." If the guess is correct, the webpage's appearance is updated to display a congratulatory message with a golden background and blue text.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to play the Number Guessing Game:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine using `git clone`
2. Open the `project3.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
1. When you open the webpage in your browser, the Number Guessing Game will start.
2. A JavaScript prompt will appear, asking you to enter a number as your guess.
3. Enter a numerical value representing your guess and click "OK."
4. The script will check if your guess matches the predefined "Magic Number."
5. If your guess is correct, the webpage's background will turn gold, the text color will change to blue, and a congratulatory message will be displayed: "Congratulations! YOU WIN."
6. If your guess is incorrect, the game will continue to prompt you for a new guess until you get it right.
