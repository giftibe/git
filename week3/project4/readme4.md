## Introduction

In this project, we have created a modal window using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The modal is displayed as a floating overlay on the webpage and can be opened and closed using buttons. We have implemented the modal window functionality within a JavaScript class named `myModalClass`. The class provides methods to open and close the modal, as well as the ability to update the modal's content dynamically.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to experience the Modal:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine using `git clone`
2. Open the `project4.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. When you open the webpage, you will see the title "Modal creation" along with some instructions.
2. The page displays a "OPEN MODAL" button, which, when clicked, will open the modal window.
3. The modal window will appear with a predefined title and text content.
4. You can close the modal by clicking the "Close Modal" button inside the modal window.
5. Additionally, the JavaScript class `myModalClass` provides a method to change the content of the modal dynamically. You can use this feature to update the title and text content of the modal.
