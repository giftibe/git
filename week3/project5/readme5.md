## Introduction
In this project, we have created a straightforward HTML webpage with an animated title. The title "Animation Project" is stylized using the "Pacifico" font from Google Fonts. Each letter of the title is split into individual span elements. When the mouse hovers over each letter, it scales up and rotates slightly, providing an interesting animation effect. This animation is achieved using JavaScript event listeners.

## Getting Started
To experience the animated title effect, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open the `project5.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Upon opening the webpage, you will see the title "Animation Project" displayed in the stylized "Pacifico" font.
2. Hover the mouse over each letter of the title to observe the animation effect. Each letter will scale up and rotate slightly on mouseover.
3. The animation is implemented using event listeners in JavaScript.

## Fonts
The "Pacifico" font used in this project is fetched from Google Fonts via the link in the HTML head. If you want to change the font or use a different font, you can modify the `<link>` tag accordingly and update the CSS styles for the title.
