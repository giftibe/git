## Introduction
In this project, we have created a user-friendly webpage that utilizes event listeners to change the appearance of the content dynamically. The page includes three input fields: "Background color," "Text color," and "Font size." As users type in these input fields, event listeners detect the input changes and update the relevant CSS properties of the page accordingly.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to try out the Event Listeners feature:

1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine using `git clone`
2. Open the `project2.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage
1. When you open the webpage in your browser, you will see a heading that says "Event Listeners."
2. Below the heading, there are three input fields:
   - "Background color": Users can input a valid color value (e.g., "#FF5733" or "red") to change the background color of the page.
   - "Text color": Users can input a valid color value to change the text color of the page.
   - "Font size": Users can input a numeric value to adjust the font size of the page's content.
3. As users type in any of the input fields, the event listeners will detect the input changes and update the corresponding CSS properties of the webpage in real-time.
4. The webpage's background color, text color, and font size will be customized according to the user's input.
